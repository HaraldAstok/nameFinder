# TEST TASK TO FIND NAMES USING CMD

## Requirements

-   Node - any version should do (but should be 12 or higher)

## How to use
-   Go to the folder where `main.js` is located and run `node main.js`
-   When using default path for a file to search from, program will search from `names.txt` which is located at teh same folder as `main.js`
-   Press `Q` any time you want to quit the programm

## Notes
-   I was thinking about using pagination for larger files, to avoid max memory limit, but the max limit is around 16GB
-   Program currently supports searching only using full name
